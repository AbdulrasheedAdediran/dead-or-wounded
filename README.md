## About

Dead or Wounded (DOW) is a play-to-earn decentralised game where players can earn DOW tokens (Dead or Wounded dApp native token).
Early adopters are rewarded with some free DOW tokens on their first interaction with the dApp to gain access to play, as players are required to spend DOW tokens to access the game.
There are four unique random numbers for each game. The goal is to guess the correct number and correct position of all four numbers.
Players stand a chance to win more DOW tokens for each round they win. The amount of token a player wins will be determined by their performance in the game.
A number is considered to be wounded if it is part of the sequence but in the wrong position.
A number is considered to be dead if it is part of the sequence and you got the position right
Dead or Wounded is beginner friendly and does not require players to have any technical knowledge as it seeks to improve adoption of Web3 and give users the opportunity to earn while having fun.

### **`Roadmap & future development`**

The project is to be developed into a multiplayer/ stake to play platform, where players stake their DOW tokens against their scores on each game.
Also, as simple as the game seems, it's quite technical to figure out, and requires some form of logical reasoning to win. This is why we are in the process of implementing algorithms that could help reduce and decrease difficulty level per userâ€™s request.
Lastly, The user experience is also a major appeal for the game, which is why we plan to keep improving the user's experience as we progress, as the goal is to keep it as user intuitive and friendly as possible.
